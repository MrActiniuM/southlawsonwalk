        <br>
        <p>Hey everyone, Zeb here. Today I want to show you all about the walk I did on 13 July 2024, at the <strong>South Lawson Waterfall Circuit.</strong> It is a relatively simple walk that visits five stunning waterfalls through the wet and dry forest of the South Lawson Park. It was built in 1878, and is owned by the Lawson Council. Let's dive in!</p>
        <h2>Preperations &amp; Directions</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Alright, since this is a relatively simple walk, it would take you about 1 to 2 hours to complete the walk. The walk is dog-friendly and kid-friendly because it is not owned by NPWS, but the local council. The track does tend to get a tad bit muddy after prolonged rain, but it will be fine as I will show you a list of what you'll need:</p>
        <p>Hiking Boots or shoes</p>
        <p>Food</p>
        <p>Warm clothes (Unless it's summer)</p>
        <p>Camera or phone (optional)</p>
        <p>Now for directions. From Sydney, follow the M4 Western Motorway for several kilometres to turn into the A32 Great Western Highway. If you hadn't packed food, then stop at the town of Blaxland for the only fast-food restaurant; a Maccas. After Blaxland, follow the A32 until Lawson, where you turn left on Honour Ave. Follow Honour Ave until you meet Livingstone St on your left. To your right, would be a small carpark and the start of our walk.</p>
        <h2>The Walk</h2>
        <p>Start a few metres north of the carpark, and there will be a sign indicating the start of the walk.</p>
        <P>Follow this walking track south-east descending steps that lead down to a track junction. The return will be from the left. Ignore the walking track on the right, as this leads to a dog park, and continue straight descending to a fenced lookout to get a not-so-good view of our first fall, Adelina Falls.</P>
        <p>Continue on the track to a track juction. Take the track on the right, which leads to the base of Adelina Falls.</p>
        <img height="500px" width="380px" src="Adelina Falls.jpg" alt="Adelina Falls">
        <p>After enjoying the falls, return to the track junction and head right, on a particularly muddy track to Junction Falls. Continue on this track until the wild roaring of Junction Falls can be heard at a track juction. Take the track on the right, heading up a rock, and encountering a fence. Descend to a creek, then cross it to shorty arrive at Juncion Falls. There are actually two falls with the name "Junction", one on the left, and another one shortly due north-east. It is essential to know that at the base of the 1st Junction Falls, there is a small plaque on a rock saying "In memory of Prue Angell. Passed away at 54 while hiking in Slovenia. The five waterfalls walk was Prue's favourite walk."</p>

        <img height="500px" width="380px" src="Junction Falls 2.jpg" alt="Junction Falls again">
        <p>Cross the footbridge over Lawson Creek, then continuing on the walk toward Federal Falls. Keep walking until a track junction with stairs leading up to the left. Take the track on the right, swerving north, then shortly arriving at Federal Falls. The sandy beach below the falls is great for a picnic, if you have food, or great for swimming in summer.</p>
        <img height="500px" width="380px" src="Federal Falls.jpg" alt="Federal Falls">
        <p>Return to the track after admiring Federal Falls, and return to the track junction with stairs. Hike up the stairs, and continue on a track, following Cataract Creek on your left. Continue to an unmarked track junction just before some stepping stones. It is worth taking the unmarked track west to encounter a small cascade, above a good swimming hole. Cross the stepping stones, and continue to a track junction. Take the track on the left, which leads to the bottom sector of Cataract Falls, with a great swimming hole. Return to the track junction, and continue north to another track junction. Take the track on the left to the iconic top sector of Cataract Falls. You could venture onto the dangerously slippery orange rock slabs closer to the falls, but take care, as it is very slippery.</p>

        <p>Return to the track juction and climb up the stairs to a track junction. Take the track on the left, and walk up to another junction. Take the left track again, to another junction. Take the track on the right, leading to a carpark. </p>
        <p>Okay, enough junctions!!! Continue to a management track after a locked gate, heading north-west-west. Ignore all track junctions on the right, and continue to a four-way track junction. Take the track on the right, which will lead you back to the carpark.</p>
        <h2>I hope you enjoyed the walk!!</h2>
